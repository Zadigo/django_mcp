# Runners

## Documentation

* Official documentation: [Asyncio Runners](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html)

This section outlines high-level asyncio primitives to run asyncio code.

They are built on top of an [event loop](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio-event-loop) with the aim to simplify async code usage for common wide-spread scenarios.

## Running an asyncio Program - [Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#running-an-asyncio-program)

### `asyncio.run(coroutine, *,  debug=None, loop_factory=None)` - [Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run)

Execute *coroutine* in an asyncio event loop and return the result.

> [!TIP]
> The argument can be any awaitable object.
>
> This function runs the awaitable, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop,  *finalizing asynchronous generators* , and closing the executor.

> [!WARNING]
> This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If `debug` is `True`, the event loop will be run in debug mode. `False` disables debug mode explicitly. `None` is used to respect the global [Debug Mode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-dev.html#asyncio-debug-mode) settings.

If `loop_factory` is not `None`, it is used to create a new event loop; otherwise [`asyncio.new_event_loop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.new_event_loop) is used. The loop is closed at the end. This function should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once. It is recommended to use `loop_factory` to configure the event loop instead of policies. Passing [`asyncio.EventLoop`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.EventLoop "asyncio.EventLoop") allows running asyncio without the policy system.

The executor is given a timeout duration of 5 minutes to shutdown. If the executor hasn’t finished within that duration, a warning is emitted and the executor is closed.

Example:

```python
async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `asyncio` policy system is deprecated and will be removed in Python 3.16; from there on, an explicit `loop_factory` is needed to configure the event loop.

## Runner context manager - [Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#runner-context-manager)

### `class asyncio.Runner(*,  debug=None,  loop_factory=None)` - [Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner)

A context manager that simplifies *multiple* async function calls in the same context. For example:

```python
with asyncio.Runner() as runner:
    # First operation sets up connections
    result1 = runner.run(setup_database())
    
    # Second operation can rely on loop state
    result2 = runner.run(process_data())
    
    # Third operation cleans up
    runner.run(cleanup())
```

Sometimes several top-level async functions should be called in the same [event loop](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio-event-loop) and [`contextvars.Context`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html#contextvars.Context).

If `debug` is `True`, the event loop will be run in debug mode. `False` disables debug mode explicitly. `None` is used to respect the global [Debug Mode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-dev.html#asyncio-debug-mode) settings.

`loop_factory` could be used for overriding the loop creation. It is the responsibility of the `loop_factory` to set the created loop as the current one. By default [`asyncio.new_event_loop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.new_event_loop) is used and set as current event loop with [`asyncio.set_event_loop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.set_event_loop) if `loop_factory` is `None`.

The same event loop persists across multiple run() calls within the context manager. This matters when:

* You have setup/teardown needs - You want to initialize resources once and reuse them
* You're running tests - Each test can use the same runner but remain isolated
* You want consistent state - Loop policies, debug settings, etc. stay consistent

### `run(coroutine, *, context=None)` - [Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner.run)

Execute *coroutine* in the embedded event loop.

* The argument can be any awaitable object.
* If the argument is a coroutine, it is wrapped in a Task.
* An optional keyword-only *context* argument allows specifying a custom [`contextvars.Context`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html#contextvars.Context) for the code to run in. The runner’s default context is used if context is `None`.
* Returns the awaitable’s result or raises an exception.
* This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

Changed in version 3.14: *coroutine* can be any awaitable object.

### `close()` - [Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner.close)

Close the runner.

Finalize asynchronous generators, shutdown default executor, close the event loop and release embedded [`contextvars.Context`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html#contextvars.Context).

### `get_loop()` - [Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner.get_loop)

Return the event loop associated with the runner instance.

> [!NOTE]
> [`Runner`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner) uses the lazy initialization strategy, its constructor doesn’t initialize underlying low-level structures.

Embedded *loop* and *context* are created at the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) body entering or the first call of [`run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run) or [`get_loop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner.get_loop).

## Handling Keyboard Interruption - [Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#handling-keyboard-interruption)

When [`signal.SIGINT`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.SIGINT) is raised by Ctrl-C, [`KeyboardInterrupt`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt) exception is raised in the main thread by default. However this doesn’t work with [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio) because it can interrupt asyncio internals and can hang the program from exiting.

To mitigate this issue, [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio) handles [`signal.SIGINT`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.SIGINT) as follows:

1. [`asyncio.Runner.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner.run "asyncio.Runner.run") installs a custom [`signal.SIGINT`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.SIGINT) handler before any user code is executed and removes it when exiting from the function.
2. The [`Runner`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner) creates the main task for the passed coroutine for its execution.
3. When [`signal.SIGINT`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.SIGINT) is raised by Ctrl-C, the custom signal handler cancels the main task by calling [`asyncio.Task.cancel()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task.cancel) which raises [`asyncio.CancelledError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError) inside the main task. This causes the Python stack to unwind, `try/except` and `try/finally` blocks can be used for resource cleanup. After the main task is cancelled, [`asyncio.Runner.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner.run "asyncio.Runner.run") raises [`KeyboardInterrupt`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt).
4. A user could write a tight loop which cannot be interrupted by [`asyncio.Task.cancel()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task.cancel "asyncio.Task.cancel"), in which case the second following Ctrl-C immediately raises the [`KeyboardInterrupt`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt) without cancelling the main task.
